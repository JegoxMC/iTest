# Samsung iTest
Was bored and "hacked" Samsung iTest.
Demo: https://ecstatic-davinci-9690f7.netlify.app/

### To make this work:
- Open "index.html" or https://ecstatic-davinci-9690f7.netlify.app/ with Google Chrome or any other Chromium browser.
- Open Inspect Element/DevTools, Press ctrl+shift+m, and set the device (at the top, dimensions) to "iPhone 12 Pro".
- ~~Open Inspect Element/DevTools & resize until you reach under 980px width (recommended under 400px for the "mobile experience").
  You can also resize your browser window to those dimensions for the same effect, I only said this for people who like to leave it fullscreened.~~
- Refresh the page and have fun!.
